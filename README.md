# react-portfolio

## Project Description
This is my portfolio which I built using react. It is made with Reactjs, CSS, and emailjs. I learned a lot about Reactjs and CSS through this project. Emailjs is used so that anyone who visits my site can send me an email. It was really fun to explore how to use CSS to build this page. Youtube was very helpful, but making the pages responsive and have a nice design was definitely the hardest part of this project.

Link to the deployed application:

## Installation
Clone the directory (https://github.com/drewrvaz/My-New-React-Portfolio), then run npm i , npm run build, npm run develop.

## Functionality
To move around the site, you can either use the buttons in the header, or use the floating nav on the page. There is also a button that a visitor can use to download my resume.
